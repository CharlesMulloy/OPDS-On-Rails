This application is really easy to use. You only need to follow the setup instructions once, then you can launch the application at will.

Requirements:

	1. Ruby 2.0.0
	2. RubyGems (probably already installed if you have Ruby)

Setup:

	1. Download the project to a folder on your computer. 
	2. Navigate to the root folder of the application in a terminal. 
	3. Run the command 'bundle install'. 
	4. Create a folder called 'files' and place it at the root of the application. Your files are listed in real time.

Launch:

	1. Navigate to the root of the project (skip this step if you are already there)
	2. Run the command 'rails s'

Configuration:
	When you connect to the OPDS using your reader, make sure that you connect to port 3000. This application only supports .epub files at the moment.
